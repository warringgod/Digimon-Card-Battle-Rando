# Digimon-Card-Battle-Rando

I'M TERRIBLE AT MAKING UI AND I'M ALSO A TERRIBLE CODER SO SORRY IN ADVANCE.
I also haven't quite finished this and made it "fully" customisable for the average non coder.

## How to Use
 
 You'll need to edit randomize.py because i cant make a UI.
 Only change the bits which say CHANGE ME (currently between line 29 and 37)
 Unless you know how to code as likely to break something

SETTINGS
---------------------------------------------------------------------

All the following "change values" will generate a random value between 80% and 120%
Of the cards ORIGINAL value.

Change_HP = True

Change_Circle = True

Change_Triangle = True

Change_Cross = True

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Cross effect change, there have been balances,so that counter always makes 0 X power
Going from 0 to "none" has a normal amount of X power and such, to make nothing too broken or bad.

Change_Cross_Effect = True

---------------------------------------------------------------------

There will be a 8/10 chance of having the normal dp, but 1/10 of having +- 10dp

Change_Plus_DP = True

---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The number of cards to change element for, does not affect partners.
 I recommend not doing more than 50 unless you want some real crazy, 
 If you put more than 172 (all avail) then it will error.
 
Change_Element = 25

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Will randomise the decks of opponents, changing options but keeping the same
Type and number of rookies, champs and ultimates. if change element is only
Then a "formerly" dark card could replace a fire card in a fire deck.

Randomise_Enemy_Decks = True
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Buffs rare cards stats by 10% across the board. (before the randomisation)

Buff_Rare = True

---------------------------------------------------------------------

To create a randomised rom, run the .exe file.

Made using the simple randomiser maker, which is super awesome
